# on-step-clothing2.0
Revamp of on step clothing. This is a quick starter which will house different backend methods and even serverless approaches.

# Reason behind

I think this will give developers a good feel and learn how things work in modern day programming teams and companies. I have read many different articles, spoken with many different programmers and even sought out some certifications. I also know that when I was learning things it helped to have some sort of an example to rely on to better understand what exactly is going on. Any changes are welcome as this is open source and a judgement free zone. Any contributions are welcomed.

## Methods

Some functional programming as it doesn't solve every problem. Some actual algorithms that you would get tested on to see how they would work in real life scenarios. Even some tests that companies will give you like API calls, implementations to UI creation, testing and even simple things such as fetching data via certain event changes.


## Features

This quickstart setup, which is what it is, will include some extra side things such as helpers in different languages (even though lisp is the actual only language, change my mind), structure and so on. I will try to add documentation for everything and break up code to make it easier to read while following logical security standards from OWASP to other security researcher's perspectives.

## Gradual Building
This project isn't done in a day, but in sprints. So certain things will be added, project will be created and so on.
